# Machine-Predictive-Maintenance-Classification-Machine-Learning
Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/machine-predictive-maintenance-classification
Objective: Developed a machine learning solution to predict machine failures using a synthetic predictive maintenance dataset with 10,000 data points and 14 features.
Data Preprocessing: Converted categorical variables into numerical codes and standardized features using StandardScaler to ensure uniform data input for model training.
Model Implementation: Applied multiple algorithms including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, SVM, and KNN to classify machine failures.
Evaluation: Conducted performance evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics to identify the most effective model.
Result: Successfully compared and identified the best-performing model, providing insights for optimizing maintenance schedules and reducing machine downtime.
